# Human User Guide For Owen Niblock @owenniblock
This is in instruction manual for interacting with an Owen Niblock. The goal of a human user guide is to make working together and collaboration with colleagues easier, faster. The focus for this user guide is on the workplace. As such, many of the questions are geared towards information that would be pertinent to your colleagues.

I got this template from @matthewmccullough's wonderful [human interaction templates](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/human-interaction-templates/blob/master/human-user-guide.md).

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I love cats (I have two black cats: Frodo and Beorn)
* I read a lot, especially fantasy and sci-fi (hence the cats names)
* I'm autistic and proud :yay:
* I am filled with feeling of inadequacy if there are team meetings that I can't make because of timezones or my out of work schedule
	
### What makes you angry? :hulk:
* Lying and unfairness
* Being late for things (I'm forgiving for when other people are late, just not myself)
* Punching down

### What are your quirks?
* I touch my face a lot when I'm nervous
* I hate silence in meetings and will talk, even if it's to say "I'm leaving a silence here for other folk to comment"
* I make random noises, often popping noises or kinda humming noises
* I (and the family) make up songs to the tunes of classic soundtracks
		
### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* I work late on a Monday and Wednesday and like it. It's a good time to schedule a call with me (esp 9-10pm UK time)
* I'm an extroverted introvert (an ambivert): introverted in a social environment but I like to perform and be the center of attention on my own terms
* I can appear direct and am very honest but underneath I am kind and empathic (where-ever possible)

### How do you like to make decisions?
* I am a big fan of gut reaction, I think it gives you a real sense of what's important
* I like to make decisions on my own and then get feedback afterwards
* If you disagree with a decision I've made, I'm very happy to learn why and not scared of changing my approach based on a discussion around that difference
  * The best way to give me that kind of feedback is initially via a DM (on Slack if that's where we are) and we can always move the discussion somewhere public if it feels important to do so

### How do you react to conflict?
* I hate conflict and will do everything I can to diffuse the situation - please don't be cross with me!

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* Honesty: tell me the truth :-)
* Kindness: I appreciate when folks operate with kindness in their hearts
* Flexibility: life sometimes gets in the way, I love it when folks are happy to reschedule or move stuff around to fit everyone's needs
* A desire to work both synchronously as well as asynchronously (sometimes I favour one or the other depending on [how many spoons I have](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-autism-spectrum-disorder/202211/what-is-the-spoons-theory-autism)

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* Ask if we can chat with no additional context
* Organise meetings without agendas (even if the title kind of explains the meeting subject)
* I wish folks wouldn't always book meetings for the start of the US day (I'm always on the school run)
	
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Providing good context when communicating (I really like it when someone will reach out to me before booking a meeting to just say "hey, how's your schedule for _this week/day/whatever_ can we chat about _this subject_ before _this deadline_?")
* Ask me about one of my special interests :-) (my kids, comedy, books, neurodivergence, mental health awareness, accessibility, computer games)

## About my interactions
	
### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* Slack in the first instance (a DM is cool)
* Zoom if we chat on Slack and decide a face-to-face discussion makes more sense
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Tell me why, data is cool but reasoning without data is fine too
* Get me excited about it
* I like work (sometimes doing work) that involves small repetative tasks that require minimal brain space. I think I use them to reset my brain a little and give space for more complicated work. And it's fun!

### What's the worst way to convince you to do something?
* I am less likely to engage with work that feels like admin, or writing up something that I'm not sure about.
* I'm not super keen on enforced fun social activities (even when I love the people the activity is with).
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* Async, over Slack or Reflective/Connect/Word doc. Anything that gives me the ability to think, edit, and edit again before sharing

### How do you like to get feedback?
* Also async!
