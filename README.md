A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a developer
named Owen Niblock battled with dark, unknown forces
(bugs) while he tried to work out if he was a comedian,
musician, geek, poet, father or (full-time) weirdo.
It turned out he was all 6, but that sort of awareness
only came when he finally accepted his fate.
