# Short Bio of Owen Niblock

Owen is a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub (currently part of the Issues teams) but he previous moved around:
3 years in GitHub's Accessibility Engineering team
2 years working on npm
2 years working on MS App Center Test.

He started as a C# developer specialising in Sitecore CMS websites before accidentally becoming a Ruby/Rails developer at App Center (he was hired to work on Windows automation but that never happened :-)) Then he accidentally became a node developer at npm before moving back to Rails & React on the Accessibility Team. So basically he's good at lots of different things but not an expert (except maybe in accessibility). He's good at diagnosing issues but needs to decide on a language and learn it properly ;-)

With his other hat on (he likes hats) he's a proud member of the Neurocats LT and usually organises the Neurgonomics meetings you'll see during Day of Learning.

If you want to get to know him, ask him about one of his specialist subject (his cats, children, neurodiversity, star trek, stand-up comedy, sci-fi & fantasy books).
